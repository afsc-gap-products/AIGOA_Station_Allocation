<p>The Aleutian Islands (AI) bottom trawl survey (BTS) is a stratified
random design with XX strata consisting of combinations of management
area (Southern Bering Sea, Eastern AI, Central AI, and Western AI) and
depth bin (1 – 100 m, 101 – 200 m. 201 – 300 m, 301 – 500 m). The Gulf
of Alaska (GOA) BTS from 1984-2023 consisted of XX strata consisting of
combinations of International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (INPFC)
management area (Shumagin, Chirikof, Kodiak, Yakutat, Southeast Alaska),
depth bin (1 – 100 m, 101 – 200 m. 201 – 300 m, 301 – 500 m, 501 – 700
m, 701 – 1000 m). These GOA strata are secondarily classified by
terrain—shelf, gully, and slope. The station allocation consists of a
modified multi-species Neyman allocation scheme that takes into account
survey variance and potential economic value across a suite of taxa as
well as stratum area.</p>
<p>First, the estimated total biomass for a subset of species (Table 1)
are calculated starting from 1991 in the AI and 1990 in the GOA to the
most recent year’s survey. Along with total biomass, stratum survey
standard deviation is also calculated.</p>
<p>Second, ex-vessel prices imported from Commercial Operator’s Annual
Report provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for a specific
list of taxa for the year of the most recent BTS, e.g., the 2022 prices
were used when planning for the AI 2024 survey. These ex-vessel prices
are averaged over the entire state of Alaska (Table 1). The list of
species represent economically important and assessed species with the
exception of sablefish and Pacific halibut. These two species have much
higher ex-vessel prices and end up solely influencing the station
allocation if included. Potential economic value is the product of
estimated total biomass and ex-vessel price. The term “potential” is
used to acknowledge that this economic value is not extracted from the
fishing process. The actual realized economic value would include total
landings data instead of estimated total biomass.</p>

<p>Third, for each taxon, the optimal station allocation using the
Neyman formula is calculated across strata. Then for each stratum, the
optimal allocated stations across years are averaged to create a
year-averaged optimal allocation for each taxon. The stratum optimal
allocation is then a weighted average across species using the potential
economic value as the weight.</p>
<p>Fourth, stations are randomly drawn within each stratum and randomly
assigned to fishing vessels. In the Aleutian Islands, the sampling frame
only consists of historically trawlable stations. However, since 2022, a
small percentage of stations are randomly chosen for vessels to find new
stations within their respective strata. The strata chosen for new
stations are balanced between large strata (i.e., strata that are easier
to find new stations) and thin strata (i.e., strata that are harder to
find stations) and are split between fishing vessels. In the GOA, the
sampling frame only excludes historically untrawlable stations. Vessel
assignments of stations are randomized in the GOA except for in the
Kodiak INPFC management area where the vessels “lane” with one vessel
covering stations north of Kodiak and into Lower Cook Inlet and the
other vessel covering stations south of Kodiak.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Stations</strong>: There are opportunities to conduct
stations in excess of the prescribed total number of stations. To guide
which strata to which these “bonus” stations should be allocated, the
station allocation process is recalculated with a higher total number of
stations, with the strata containing bonus stations being those with
higher allocated stations. For example, in the AI 2024 station
allocation, 400 stations were initially allocated. Then, the same
procedure was conducted using a higher 420 stations and the strata with
excess stations were those that contained extra stations. Bonus stations
are shared between the vessels and it is up to the discretion of the
field party chiefs and vessel captains on both vessels as to when bonus
stations are conducted and where the bonus stations (within their
respective strata) are conducted.</p>
